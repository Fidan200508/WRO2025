To satisfy WRO rules:

We implement two-button start: one physical power switch to turn the vehicle ON (powering all electronics), and a separate START button which when pressed will begin the autonomous program loop.

No additional human interactions during rounds.

We implement a clearly labelled emergency stop that instantly cuts motor power but leaves the logic board powered for data collection.

Startup sequence in main.py:
Power ON switch powers the system.
Health checks run (sensor presence, battery level, motor driver alive, no errors).
WAIT for user to press START button.
When START pressed, LED blinks and the autonomous process begins.
